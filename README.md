dotfiles
========

This repository is a collection of my dotfiles I need to synchronize across
computers.
Currently, it is mostly emacs, but more things may come as soon they are
non-trivial.

Feel free to use these, or take stuff out of them - I created these files
using many sources and experimenting a lot. This is work in progress, as
usual when you're not "done" yet.

Any hints or suggestions are welcome - feel free to contact me.
